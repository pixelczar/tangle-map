# Tangle Map

A generative art tool that visualizes the complex relationships between concepts, ideas, and systems. When you close your eyes and think about how ideas connect, they often exist in a 3D space—blobs of concepts relating to one another, reminiscent of aerial photography, maps, and land use diagrams.

## The Tension

Tangle Map explores the tension between the organic and the precise. Each generation creates a unique landscape where:

- **Clusters** represent core concepts or epicenters
- **Rivers** flow between ideas, sometimes terminating in deltas
- **Vegetation patches** show organic growth around concepts
- **Particles** burst from plot areas, representing energy and activity
- **Grid systems** provide structural foundation

## Features

- **Generative Art**: Each refresh creates a new, unique composition
- **Interactive Controls**: Toggle layers, adjust parameters, and explore variations
- **Swiss Typography**: Clean, minimal interface with edition tracking
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade effects for regenerating content

## Technology

- React with Canvas API
- Custom layer system for modular rendering
- Perlin noise for organic shapes
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- LocalStorage for state persistence

## Usage

1. Click "Redraw" to generate a new composition
2. Use "Controls" to toggle layers and adjust parameters
3. Each generation gets a unique edition ID
4. Explore the tension between structure and organic growth

## Philosophy

Tangle Map is about making the invisible visible—turning abstract conceptual relationships into tangible, beautiful forms that exist somewhere between maps and dreams.
